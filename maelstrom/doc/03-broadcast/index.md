# Chapter 3: Broadcast

In this chapter, we generalize our [echo server](/doc/02-echo/index.md) to a
re-usable Node class, and build a simple gossip-based broadcast system.
We explore the impact of various network topologies on message volume and
effective latency, and make our gossip protocol robust to network failures.
